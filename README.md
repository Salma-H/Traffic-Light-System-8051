# Traffic Light Using Intel 8051 Silicon Labs Kit With Assembly


## This is an implementation of a traffic light that has the following features:

- Gives the user access to control the frequency of counting of the two 7-segments according to how crowded or empty the streets are.

- The user has the ability to choose between 3 different frequencies [Fast- Medium (Default)- Slow]

- The Default max number shown on the 7-segments is 30 but the user has the ability to change that number to whatever suitable depending on the different traffic conditions.

- After setting the desired frequency and max number then the lights will alternate between red and green light.




### Files in this repository are classified in two:

1. Files for simulation for testing purposes (we used a similar kit to 8051 but not identical).
2. Files for the real kit and they are tested as well.
